 One way UTXOs can be gotten directly from the node is with RPC command - 'gettxout'
 However this accepts a single transaction as a parameter, making it impratical to use
 directly when getting UTXOs by address/public key. The best idea will be to index the
 all UTXOs from the blockchain in a db (just like with wallets and transactions on bcoin)
 and extend the bcoin RPC server. To return the nodes.
 Also consider - if this is a client wallet that can be run with a custom server, there will
 need to be a default alternative outside Oyl Api (e.g the blockchainApi)
